# machine-learning 


Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive and yet simple course in Machine Learning using Python.

Motivation
Machine Learning, as a tool for Artificial Intelligence, is one of the most widely adopted scientific fields. A considerable amount of literature has been published on Machine Learning. The purpose of this project is to provide the most important aspects of Machine Learning by presenting a series of simple and yet comprehensive tutorials using Python. In this project, we built our tutorials using many different well-known Machine Learning frameworks such as Scikit-learn. In this project you will learn:

What is the definition of Machine Learning?
When it started and what is the trending evolution?
What are the Machine Learning categories and subcategories?
What are the mostly used Machine Learning algorithms and how to implement them?
